An example of this is on the MTEB benchmark, a text-embedding-3-large embedding can be shortened to a size of 256 while still outperforming an unshortened text-embedding-ada-002 embedding with a size of 1536. Shortening the dimensions parameter trades off some accuracy in exchange for smaller vector size and cost. OpenAI uses Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) to enable this by embedding concept information at different granularities, allowing for smaller vectors without losing significant semantic meaning.

    "Before we do that, let's stop and think a bit about how OpenAI's chat models work.\n",
    "\n",
    "We know they have roles - as is indicated in the following API [documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create#chat/create-messages)\n",

    "\n",
    "- `{\"role\" : \"system\"}` : The system message helps set the behavior of the assistant. For example, you can modify the personality of the assistant or provide specific instructions about how it should behave throughout the conversation. However note that the system message is optional and the model’s behavior without a system message is likely to be similar to using a generic message such as \"You are a helpful assistant.\"\n",
    "- `{\"role\" : \"user\"}` : The user messages provide requests or comments for the assistant to respond to.\n",
    "- `{\"role\" : \"assistant\"}` : Assistant messages store previous assistant responses, but can also be written by you to give examples of desired behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea is this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You start with a system message that outlines how the LLM should respond, what kind of behaviours you can expect from it, and more\n",
    "2. Then, you can provide a few examples in the form of \"assistant\"/\"user\" pairs\n",
    "3. Then, you prompt the model with the true \"user\" message.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we'll be forgoing the 2nd step for simplicities sake."

      "It is logical and often beneficial to include individual investments within a portfolio that may be far riskier than one would normally be comfortable with if the potential return is sufficiently attractive. Conversely, it can also be beneficial to include investments that are far less risky and offer lower return potential to protect against downside risks. The key point is that the significance lies not in the risk of any single investment but in how all investments' risks and returns combine in the portfolio as a whole (Source 1).\n",

International exposure not only provides pragmatic benefits (experience on the ground in specific countries) but also more general benefits by broadening perspective beyond a single domestic market. Since many American companies now generate a significant portion of their revenue and profits outside the US, having a global perspective can maximize future opportunities (Source 3).\n",
